## :white_circle:About

A database management system aimed at managing and improving the quality of transactions at the Sports Block of IIIT Delhi.

Sports management in a college is an essential task. It is often difficult to coordinate amongst different people with different roles in college. The method of physically keeping records is outdated and a more efficient system is required. There is a lack of facility to reserve slots which when present, can help ease out excess work and coordination. There are a number of existing websites that lack a formal platform with all necessary information integrated for the smooth running of sports in a college. This builds our motivation to create a Sports Management System in IIITD.

## :white_circle:Work in progress :construction:

Since this was our 4th semester DBMS project and we were allotted limited time, we were assessed on the quality of the queries and efficiency of the database as a whole. But as an addition we added a basic GUI to finish off our project. 

:loudspeaker: Note that the GUI is not completely finished and doesn't fully complement our database. It can be further developed to have other operations that the queries allow.
